# Public_API_Request

Public API Request requests 12 random users from randomuser.me and displays each user's info in a card.
Clicking on the card will open a modal window containing more details about the person.
You can go back and forth through the list of people when the modal window is open with the "prev" and "next" buttons.
You can also search through the people by name with the search bar.

The background color has been changes from its original color.

This shouldn't work in Internet Explorer, since I used fetch without the polyfill.
